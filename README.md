# Lab-1

Aims of the project:

>Test  with different classification methods to see which one gives the highest accuracy
>To find out which characteristics are most characteristic of a good quality wine
Using several machine learning models, I predicted the quality of wine according to its characteristics. I used a wine quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular wine is classified as a good quality wine or a bad quality wine.For every wine in this dataset I gave  a “quality” score ranging from 0 to 10.I then converted the output to binary output and depending on the wine quality score we have good quality wine(score 7 or higher) or bad quality wine (score below 7).

We use input variable in determining quality wine i.e 
Acidity, 
Sulfur dioxide contents, 
Density, 
pH,
Sulphates, 
Alcohol,   
Quality,  
Type,
Residual sugar,  
Chlorides,
